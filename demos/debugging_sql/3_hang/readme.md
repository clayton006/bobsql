# Demos for SQL Server hangs

1. Run debug server again

Load nonyield.sql in SSMS and run it
Use requests.sql to see the status is RUNNING
After a few seconds you will see info in ERRORLOG
Wait a bit longer and you get a stack dump

2. Go to the LOG directory

Edit debughang.cmd to get the last .MDMP file
Look at the debugger header
Type in k to see the call stack
Why is this a non-yielding problem based on the assembly instruction?
Type in u and find these instructions

00007ff8`ed0b7b0a 85c0            test    eax,eax
00007ff8`ed0b7b0c 7402            je      sqlmin!NonYieldTest+0x410 (00007ff8`ed0b7b10)
00007ff8`ed0b7b0e eb02            jmp     sqlmin!NonYieldTest+0x412 (00007ff8`ed0b7b12)
00007ff8`ed0b7b10 ebb3            jmp     sqlmin!NonYieldTest+0x3c5 (00007ff8`ed0b7ac5)

These are typical of a counter and a loop. This instruction points "backwards" before our current instruction

00007ff8`ed0b7b10 ebb3            jmp     sqlmin!NonYieldTest+0x3c5 (00007ff8`ed0b7ac5)

So basically we are in a big loop not yielding to SQLOS

How is the server detecting the dump?

Type in !uniqstack
Search for SchedulerMonitor
Notice the callstack is the one triggering the dump

3. Let's see a stalled scheduler scenario

Follow the readme.md in the scheduler_deadlock folder
