# Demos for an Access Violation

1. Load up crash.sln in Visual Studio

Show the basics of the code
Hit Play
Show the console window with exit code. The number in hex is C0000005. Show winnt.h for what C0000005 means which is STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
Now uncomment the code for SEH and show the behavior. That is what SQL Server tries to do for many AVs.

2. Show an AV with SQL Server

Stop the SQL Server Service
Run the debug server from the debugsql directory using sqlservr.cmd
Load crash.sql and talk about DBCC UNITTEST
Show the ERRORLOG
Call stack is in the ERRORLOG but let's use the debugger
Go to the c:\debugsql\sqlservr\log directory. Talk about the SQLDUMPER_ERRORLOG.LOG file
Edit debugav.cmd to put in the name of the MDMP file and run it.
Show the header at the top of the debugger
To get the right AV context type in .ecxr
Type in k to see the callstack
Show the assembly instruction for the AV. Type r to see registers and show it is a write to rax which is 0.

3. Now let's have some fun and cause our own AV

Stop the debug server
Startup the SQL Server service
Attach the debugger with debugsql.cmd
Set a breakpoint with this command

bp sqllang!process_commands
g

Try to run a query with SSMS

Trace the assembly until you get to this line of code

mov     rax,qword ptr [rcx] ds:000001b3`11138f40={sqllang!CBatch::`vftable' (00007ffb`68058478)}

Now type in

bd 0
r rcx=0
gu

Go look at the ERRORLOG directory and see the AV. Notice there is no input buffer because we hit an AV before the server read in the query

Detach the debugger and shutdown SQL Server



Use the debugger on a live SQL Server and change a register to cause an AV using public symbols – Attach debugger and set breakpoint at sqllang!process_commands. After breakpoint hit hit “t” until you come to this line of code mov     rax,qword ptr [rcx] ds:000001b3`11138f40={sqllang!CBatch::`vftable' (00007ffb`68058478)}. Then execute r rcx=0 and ‘gu’. Look at ERRORLOG.
